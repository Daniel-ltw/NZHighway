NZHighway
=========

Currently it is a small project to display NZTA(New Zealand Transport Authority) TREIS(Traffic Road Event Information System) data on the Android devices. 

Plan to include navigation if everything is well. 

Once navigation runs smoothly, will consider helping NZTA with crowd reporting of road uneveness with the accelerometer on the mobile devices.



P.S.: Friends of mine who are interested to give the application a try, do contact me. I could push the application up onto your devices.
